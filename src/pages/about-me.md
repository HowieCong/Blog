## 6. Creating Impact with Technology 🌍

In 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic, I observed the need in some local medical centers and decided, along with a group of friends including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmayradiga/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayra Diaz</a>, to contribute our grain of sand by printing and donating 3D face shields. Little by little, the project grew and more people joined. Thus was born <a href="https://sdgactionawards.org/homemakersmexico/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope Makers México</a>.

In 2021, together with another great friend, Guillermo Mora, we created <a href="https://devs.tizayocan.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devs_Tiza</a>, a community for developers, designers, and technology enthusiasts. Our goal is to organize events, workshops, and mentoring to strengthen the local technology ecosystem.

## 7. Sharing Knowledge 🧠

I've always liked **sharing my knowledge**. I often give small courses or mentoring to friends, students, or companies. When questions arise from them is when I learn the most, because sometimes these questions may seem simple and the answers are something we take for granted, but perhaps we don't fully understand why it is so. This pushes us to:

- Deepen our understanding of concepts
- Understand them better
- Transform them into something that can be taught clearly and practically

> Grounding knowledge is, for me, the bridge between knowing and teaching.

### 7.1 Programming Mentoring 💻

From 2021 to the present, I have closely guided more than 15 high school students in the programming career. Taking into account that they are starting their education, when they reach the point of understanding how web pages are made, they begin with the most basic:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript (fundamentals)

I have tried to teach them this in the way I would have liked to learn it at the time, obtaining excellent results, as concepts that weren't clear to them in school could be understood and applied following this different approach.

### 7.2 Educational Content on YouTube 📹

Many of them were especially interested in frontend and wanted to better understand and master CSS. Therefore, I started creating small videos that I uploaded to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@efeeledev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> privately so they could consult them when needed.

In 2024, I recorded some <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrontEndMentor</a> challenges with better quality and published them on my channel. Currently, I share these resources with people I know who are interested in the topic and want to learn by watching how it's put into practice.

Although there are few videos, I really enjoyed the process. Due to time limitations, I haven't been able to record more, as they require a lot of dedication, but I'm sure that **I'll soon be publishing new content**.

### 7.3 Some of My Videos 🎬

Here I share some of those videos I've created to help others learn web development. Each one addresses different challenges and techniques that can be useful for those who are starting in the frontend world.

## 8. What's Next... 🚀

In 2023, **Proyecto Tizayocan** was born, an initiative that seeks to apply technology to improve education, urban management, and connectivity in the municipality. This project is still in development, and we are gathering more collaborators to continue advancing.

At the end of 2024, after years working in the city council as **_Software Development Coordinator_**, and seeing the technological deficiencies of some municipalities, **StellarGov** emerges, a web components framework with Tailwind to help developers of small governments create fast and quality websites.

## 9. A Bit More About Me ☕

Today, in 2025, I continue working as **_Software Development Coordinator_** in my municipality, collaborating with my usual clients and launching projects. I love creating things, experimenting with new ideas, and organizing events. I live with the _maker_ spirit: learning, experimenting, and sometimes causing a bit of chaos. But well, everything is forgiven if there's music and coffee involved. ☕🎶

Oh! And I'm an expert at preparing coffee. Seriously, whether it's to start the day or for a creative session, I have the perfect recipe. I'm also pretty good at board games, so if you ever need a partner for a game night, I'm your person! 🎲

I'm **HowieCong**, and I thank you for reading this.

Let's Create Amazing Things! 🚀
